# Object-Style-Changer

This is my art185 project. This program requires the user go to https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/ and follow the instructions to download yolov3. (When I tried to push darknet to git it gave me an issue about uploading a .git but the terminal instructions for yolo are very straightforward.) Project.ipynb should be placed in the folder /darknet/ that is created when yolov3 is installed. Inside your local /darknet/. You must open image.c (from /darknet/src/image.c) and replace the first print statement in the function draw_directions with printf("%s\n", names[j]); as you don't need to save the confidence values as well as add the line printf("%d, %d, %d, %d\n", left, right, top, bot); just before the draw_box_width call later in the same function. Running the make command in terminal will apply your changes in image.c to yolo.

The test folder contains the original picture and all of the pictures generated by my code. The style test folder contains the isolated objects, some styles, and the new style shifted objects (note that a style shifted background (mainComp7) is in the main folder while the other style change pics are in the /mods/ folder.) mods/ has style changes where all objects of the same type have the same style while /mods/varied/ has each picture with a differnt style. https://reiinakano.github.io/fast-style-transfer-deeplearnjs/ ran the style transfer and provided a few styles not in the set of paintings included in /style test/.
